    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Command Lookup Tool</strong><br><br>
        The Command Look Up Tool will be a useful website that would make understanding terminal commands simple. It is  aimed for anyone who uses computer and wants to learn more on utilising commands to complete tasks quickly and efficiently.<br>
        The command lookup tool allows you to:<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Find Commands by Name: One can simply put in the name of the command they want to learn about, such as "ls" or "cd" ,and the programme will walk you through what is does and how to use it.</li>
            <li>Search by Action: If you don't know which command to use for something specefic, you can briefly describe what you want to accomplish, and the tool will show the relevent commands that could help.</li>
            <li>Discover New Commands: Improve your command dictionary by exploring different commands to learn what they perform and how they may help you simplify your tasks..</li>
            <li>Share and Learn Together: You can also share the commands you know that could help fellow learners to better learn commands. It's a friendly place where everyone can help each other learn.</li>
        </ul><br>
        Whether you're a tech genius or just getting started with computers, the Command Lookup Tool will help you learn and grow!
